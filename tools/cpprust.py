"""cpprust -- a minimal C++ subset, lowered to C.

`#include "foo.cpp"` translates a small C++ dialect in place, the same way
`#include "foo.py"` handles rpython. What the subset buys, next to Rust rather
than instead of it, is a full **object lifecycle**: constructors chosen by
arity, copy construction and `operator=`, member and base construction
ordering, inheritance and virtual dispatch.

Crust has a `Drop` trait of its own now, so destruction alone is no longer the
reason this exists. The two meet at the symbol instead: a Rust
`impl Drop for T` lowers to `T_drop(T *self)`, which is exactly what `~T()`
lowers to here, so a C++ class may hold a Crust type *by value* and its member
epilogue calls the Rust destructor with no shim. (One difference worth
knowing: members are destroyed in reverse declaration order, because that is
C++'s rule, while Crust's field glue frees in declaration order, because that
is Rust's. Each side follows its own source language.)

C++11 spellings -- `auto`, range-`for`, namespaces, `unique_ptr` and
`shared_ptr` -- are handled in `tools/cpp_auto.py` and the supplied templates
below. None of them widen what the subset expresses: each is rewritten into
something this lowering already handled, before any pass that reads types
runs, because everything downstream reads types by how they are written.

A class may therefore *own* a Crust value rather than point at one. Crust
publishes the types it lowered that own something and the preprocessor passes
them as `--owning Name:dropfn,..`, since this module runs as a subprocess and
cannot see the unit being compiled. A member of such a type is destroyed with
its container -- so a class holding only Crust values needs no destructor at
all -- and the copy rules apply to it, so copying one without a copy
constructor is refused for the same reason as any other owning class. Without
the mapping nothing changes and the member is plain data.

The subset, deliberately small:

  * `class` / `struct` with data members and methods
  * a copy constructor, `T(const T &o)`, lowered to `T_copy` -- the one
    constructor that does not lower to `T_new`, since overloading `T_new`
    would redefine it (a second ordinary constructor is reported rather
    than emitted twice). `T b = a;` and `T b(a);` call it, and the copy is
    registered for destruction like any other local. A class with a
    destructor and no copy constructor cannot be copied: the struct copy
    would leave two objects owning one resource and destroy it twice, so
    that is an error naming the Rule of Three rather than a silent
    double free. `operator=` is not in the subset, so assigning to an
    owning object is refused for the same reason. A class with no
    destructor owns nothing, and copies bitwise exactly as C++ would.
  * a by-value owning *parameter* is an object the callee owns: it is
    constructed at the call -- moved in when the site writes `std::move`,
    copied otherwise -- and dropped on every exit from the function, which
    is what C++ does. An argument whose class has no copy constructor is an
    error naming `std::move`. A by-value *return* is still refused unless it
    returns a bare local, since the local is destroyed on the way out and
    the caller would receive a copy of a released object. A class with no
    destructor owns nothing and passes by value freely.
  * constructors and a destructor: a local `Type name(args);` becomes
    `Type_new` at the declaration and `Type_drop` at the closing `}` of the
    enclosing block (inside the `.cpp` only -- the include hook never sees
    the C TU that pulled the file in)
  * `public:` / `private:` / `protected:` labels (parsed, not enforced --
    access control is a compile-time property and this is a lowering, not a
    type checker; pretending to enforce it would be worse than not claiming to)
  * constructor overloading, resolved by argument *count*: a call site is
    matched before types are known, so arity is all there is to resolve on,
    and two constructors of the same arity are refused rather than guessed
    between. The no-argument one keeps the plain `T_new`, since that is
    what member and base default construction call; the others are
    `T_new_<n>`, with a matching `T__alloc_<n>` for `new`.
  * `operator[]`, which must return a reference (`T &`) and lowers to a
    `T *`, so `v[i]` becomes `*T__index(&v, i)` and stays an lvalue -- a
    by-value subscript would make `v[i] = x` write to a copy, so it is
    refused. A subscript on a genuine pointer *field* is left as plain C
    indexing, since `T *p; p[i]` walks an array rather than calling
    anything.
  * the binary arithmetic operators `+ - * / % | & ^`, lowered to
    `T__binadd` and so on, in the one case that has an honest lowering: a
    class that owns nothing. The operator hands back a new object *by
    value*, and a by-value return of an owning class is not in this subset
    -- the local is destroyed on the way out and the caller would receive a
    copy of a released object -- so an owning class is reported and
    pointed at `operator+=`, which writes into an object that already
    exists. Both operands must be plain names that resolve to the class;
    one that is itself an expression would need a temporary to take the
    address of, so `a + b + c` is not in this. `operator*` is told apart
    from the dereference by whether it takes an operand, which is the only
    difference between them on the page. The body may build its result the
    obvious way (`vec2 r(x + o.x, y + o.y); return r;`) -- a constructor
    call inside a method body used to reach the C unlowered whenever the
    method returned a class, which made that shape look unsupported.
  * `operator=`, lowered to `T__assign`.
    Assignment to an owning object has no safe default -- a struct copy
    leaves two owners -- so this is where the author supplies one. A chained
    `a = b = c` is refused, because the call is lowered to `void`.
  * a small `std`: `string`, `vector<T>`, `map<K,V>` and `set<T>`, supplied
    when the source names them and written in this subset rather than
    special-cased in the lowering. `set<T>` keeps its elements *sorted*,
    where `map` does not: ordering two values generically needs
    `__cpp_cmp(T, a, b)`, a three-way comparison -- two `<`s for a scalar,
    a `compare` method for a class -- and `map` predates it. Three-way
    rather than a `less` predicate because the builtin's operands are not
    symmetric: the right one arrives as an already-lowered pointer and the
    left as an lvalue, so `b < a` cannot be had by swapping the arguments
    of `a < b`. A boolean would therefore leave a container unable to
    derive equality from ordering and force it to demand `equals` too,
    where one comparison answers both. A class element with no `compare`
    is reported rather than ordered by address.
  * `priority_queue<T>`, a max-heap in an array, ordered by `__cpp_cmp`
    like `set` and `map`. Elements are sifted *by hole* -- the one being
    placed is held aside and the ones it passes are relocated with
    `memmove` into the gap -- so an owning element never has two live
    copies and needs no `operator=`. `top()` returns a `T *` rather than
    the reference `std::priority_queue` returns, since a reference return
    is not in this subset; `q[0]` reaches the same element as an lvalue.
  * `stack<T>`, `queue<T>`, `array<T,N>` and `optional<T>`, each with one
    thing it cannot do the way `std` does. `stack::top` and `queue::front`
    return `T *`, since a reference return is not in this subset, and
    `s[0]` is the same element as an lvalue -- `stack` indexes from the
    top so those two agree. `queue` keeps a head index and slides its live
    range back down when the array fills, rather than wrapping: a wrapped
    range cannot be handed out as the pointer pair every container here
    iterates as. `array<T,N>` holds a plain array *member*, which this
    subset neither constructs nor destroys, so it takes plain data only and
    an element with a constructor or destructor is refused with `vector<T>`
    named -- without that check it segfaulted on the first `fill`.
    `optional<T>` keeps its value behind a pointer rather than in a `T`
    member, because a member is constructed and destroyed with its
    container and an empty optional must hold nothing; that costs an
    allocation per engaged value, which is the price of having no
    placement new.
  * a small `<algorithm>`: `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`, `binary_search`,
    `sort`, `find`, `count`, `reverse`, `fill`, `min_element`,
    `max_element`, `swap` and `copy`, as free function templates over a
    `T *` range. `swap` takes *pointers* where `std::swap`
    takes references, because a `T &` parameter is lowered only for a class
    and `__cpp_ref(T)` gives a scalar by value -- neither spells both, and
    a swap cannot have a copy. `fill` and `copy` write into a range that
    already holds constructed elements, destroying each before
    constructing over it -- so for an element type that owns something the
    destination has to be visibly a container's own range (`begin()`,
    `ptr()`, or one local aliasing one). Anything this cannot see through
    is reported: handed raw storage it would destroy garbage and follow
    bytes nothing set, which is a segfault rather than a diagnostic. A
    plain-data element has nothing to destroy, so any destination is fine
    and the check never fires. The
    searching pair ask `__cpp_eq` rather than `__cpp_cmp`, since matching
    does not need an order and demanding one would refuse a class that
    reasonably has equality and no ordering. A call to one of these can be
    the receiver of the next (`min_element(..)->size()`), because the
    return types of the monomorphised copies are known -- unlike a call to
    plain C spelled the same way, which is still left exactly as written.
  * `string` searches a substring as `find_str`, not as an overload of
    `find`. `std::string` overloads that name on `char` and `const char *`,
    which are the same arity, and this subset resolves an overload by
    argument *count* before types are known -- so the two cannot be told
    apart and a separate name says which is meant. `rfind_str`,
    `contains`, `starts_with` and `ends_with` come with it.
  * `<numeric>`: `accumulate`, `iota`, `inner_product`, `partial_sum` and
    `adjacent_difference`, over the same `T *` ranges. These combine
    elements with `+` and `*`, so the element has to be a scalar -- a class
    would need `operator+`, which is not in this subset, and is reported
    against the call rather than left to fail inside a template body the
    author never wrote. `partial_sum` and `adjacent_difference` read each
    element before writing, so the destination may be the source.
    `accumulate` answers to its own name as well as to the header, since it
    lived in `<algorithm>` here before this header existed.
  * `unordered_map` and `unordered_set`, which are `map` and `set` under
    another name. Nothing here hashes and nothing in this subset can write
    `hash<T>` generically, so a separate copy would have the unordered
    interface and the ordered behaviour; the alias says so. Iteration comes
    out sorted, which code relying on no order is not broken by, and
    lookups are O(log n) rather than O(1), which it cannot observe. A range is a
    pair of pointers because that is already what every container here
    hands out, so these work over `vector`, `ownvector`, `set` and `map`
    without an iterator abstraction existing. Ordering goes through
    `__cpp_cmp`, so a class element supplies `compare` and these come with
    it; there is no comparator parameter, which would need a function type
    this subset cannot spell generically. `sort` relocates elements with
    `memmove` rather than assigning them, so an owning element keeps its
    one owner and needs no `operator=`; it is an insertion sort, because a
    recursive one would need the template to call itself over its own
    parameter and the instantiation scan cannot see through that.

    `sort(v.begin(), v.end())` works without spelling `<int>`, but only in
    one narrow shape: a parameter written `T *`, matched against an
    argument whose pointee this file declares -- a container's `begin()`,
    an array, or a pointer local. A deduced call is rewritten to spell its
    arguments the long way and the ordinary substitution runs on that, so
    both forms take one code path. Only the scopes still open at the call
    are read -- a brace region that closed above it is skipped -- so
    another function's locals, or an earlier block's, cannot answer for a
    name they merely share. `map` is left out on purpose: its
    iterator is a `pair<K,V> *`, so deducing `K` from `m.begin()` would be
    wrong rather than merely unsupported. Anything else -- a call result,
    a by-value parameter, more than one template parameter -- is reported,
    as is a template called with no arguments at all, which used to have
    its body blanked and its call left to fail at link time. They also need a class somewhere in the
    unit, since the builtins they compare through are expanded while
    lowering classes; a file using only `<algorithm>` is told so. `std::` is stripped; there is no namespace support and
    claiming otherwise would be worse. Element access is `get`/`set`/`ptr`,
    and `v[i]`, which the containers now overload. `vector<T>` stores
    elements by assignment, so an element type with a destructor is refused
    -- with `vector<T *>` named as the shape that does work, since a
    pointer copies cleanly and `new`/`delete` carry the lifetime.
  * lambdas, in two shapes. A *non-capturing* lambda is exactly a function
    and lowers to one -- `auto f = [](int y) -> int { .. };` becomes a
    function pointer, so the call site needs no rewriting and the lambda can
    be passed anywhere a callback goes.

    A *capturing* lambda is inlined at each call site instead. A capture
    would otherwise need the captured variable's type, to become a field of
    a closure struct, and that type is an ordinary local this pass cannot
    see -- but a body placed where the call is has those variables in scope
    already, so nothing has to be named. `return` inside the body must leave
    the lambda rather than the enclosing function, so the body goes inside
    `do { } while (0)` and `return` becomes `break`: a structured jump the
    destructor unwinding already understands, where a label and `goto` are
    refused outright whenever anything is live. A by-value capture is a copy
    taken where the lambda is written, so it becomes a snapshot local
    declared there; its type is looked up from the declaration and the
    capture is refused if that is missing or ambiguous, since guessing it
    would silently truncate. `[=]` names nothing to look up and is refused.

    Because it is inlined, a capturing lambda has no value to pass around,
    cannot recurse, and cannot be called from a loop condition or a
    short-circuit operand, where the body would not run exactly once. Each
    of those is reported. A return type must be spelled in both shapes:
    nothing here can deduce one, and defaulting to `int` would truncate.
  * `template<typename T>` on classes, monomorphised on use. Any number of
    parameters (`template<typename K, typename V>`), and a non-type integer
    parameter (`template<typename T, int N>`) works too, because
    monomorphisation is textual substitution and `N` is replaced by the
    literal the use site spelled. Arguments may themselves be
    instantiations (`Holder<Pair<int,char>>`), resolved innermost first, in
    which case the class supplying the argument must be declared above the
    one consuming it -- the same completeness rule a base class obeys. A
    template instantiated only from inside another template's body is
    reported rather than emitted as a dangling name: the scan that
    discovers instantiations cannot see through an unsubstituted parameter.
  * inherited fields, reached through the `_base` member they actually live
    in: a derived method naming a base field, and `d->field` on a derived
    object, both resolve through a recorded access path rather than
    assuming every field sits at the top of the class.
  * single inheritance, with `virtual` methods and pure virtual (`= 0`)
    declarations. A base is laid out as the first member, so a pointer to a
    derived object already *is* a pointer to its base and upcasting is a
    cast. The vtable pointer sits first in the root of the hierarchy, hence
    at offset zero throughout it, and a derived class's table begins with
    its base's slots -- which is what lets a `Base *` dispatch into a
    derived override. Overrides reached through a table go via a small
    thunk that converts `this`, so the generated table holds no
    function-pointer casts.
  * method call syntax: `g.get()` and `p->get()` become `VecGuard_get(&g)`
    and `VecGuard_get(p)`. Receivers resolve against a scope-tracked symbol
    table -- locals, parameters, and chains through class-typed fields
    (`a.b.get()`). Inside a method, a bare `helper(x)` picks up the implicit
    `this`. Anything that does not resolve to a class is left exactly as
    written, so plain C in the same file is untouched.
  * reference parameters and locals: `T &x` is a pointer the source did not
    have to spell, so it is lowered back to `T *x` and call sites take the
    address. `T &r = e;` becomes `T *r = &(e);`. Member *access* follows the
    same symbol table as a method call, so `c.v` on a lowered reference
    becomes `c->v`, and each step of a chain picks its own operator
    (`o.in.n` on a reference is `o->in.n`, since the member itself is by
    value). A receiver that does not resolve to a class is left alone, so
    plain C struct access is untouched.

A reference *return* (`T& f()`) is rejected rather than lowered. Turning it
into `T*` would silently change what assignment through the result means at
every call site, which is the same failure mode as silently making `virtual`
static.

A call can be the receiver of the next one, so `o.node()->get()` lowers to
`Node_get(Owner_node(&o))` -- each step is emitted into an expression that
becomes the next step's receiver, which is what avoids needing a temporary
in expression position. A chain only ever starts from a symbol that
resolves to a class, so legitimate C spelled the same way
(`get_ops()->init(x)`, a free function returning a struct pointer) is still
left exactly as written. A method returning a class *by value* continues the chain through a
generated `Cls__byval_meth_<n>` taking its receiver by value: C cannot take
the address of a function result, and spilling one would need a statement,
so the value goes in as a value. That is the same way out the binary
operators take for `a + b + c`, and it rests on the same condition -- the
class must own nothing, since a struct copy of an owning receiver would
leave two objects holding one resource. An owning one still ends the chain
with a diagnostic, as does a virtual call, which needs a receiver whose
address can be taken to reach the vtable; each says which of the two it
is. The variants are emitted only for the names a source actually chains
onto.

Dispatching a virtual call on a call result goes through a generated
`Decl__vcall_name` helper that takes the receiver as a parameter. The plain
dispatch form names the receiver twice -- once to reach the vptr, once as
the argument -- which is harmless for a name and wrong for a call, where
`f.make()->area()` would build two objects. The helper is emitted only for
the slots a source actually chains onto.

Drops run on every exit from a scope: the closing `}`, and also `return`,
`break` and `continue`. `return` unwinds out to the function, `break` to the
enclosing loop or switch, `continue` to the enclosing loop. A `return` with a
value spills it to a temporary before the destructors run, because C++
evaluates the operand first and `return g.get();` reads the very object about
to be destroyed.

`goto` is rejected when a destructor is pending: where it lands decides what
should have been destroyed, and a lowering that scans forward cannot know
that. With nothing live it is left alone, so plain C is unaffected.

A class-typed member is constructed and destroyed with its container, in
declaration order and reverse declaration order respectively. If a member
needs either and the container declares neither, the container gets an
implicit one, as in C++. A constructor initializer list (`C(int n) : a(n),
k(n) { }`) supplies arguments to a member's constructor, or assigns a scalar
field. A member whose class has no default constructor must appear in the
initializer list -- that is an error rather than a silently unconstructed
object. Pointer and array members are left to the author.

Constructors run base first, then install the vtable pointer, then members,
then the body; destructors run the body, then members in reverse, then the
base. A class with a base, a member, or a vtable that needs either gets an
implicit constructor or destructor. A class with a pure virtual method is
abstract: no table is emitted for it and declaring one by value is an error
rather than an object whose vptr is never set.

`new` and `delete` allocate and destroy a single object. `new T(args)` sits
in expression position and C has no statement expression, so it lowers to a
generated `T__alloc(args)` -- malloc, construct, return -- emitted only for
the classes the source actually applies `new` to. A failed malloc yields
null rather than being constructed through, since the subset has no
exceptions. `delete p` is a statement, so it lowers in place to a guarded
`T_drop(p); free(p);` -- guarded because `delete` on null is a no-op in C++,
and wrapped in `do { } while (0)` so that a delete as a branch's only
statement does not leave a stray `;` before an `else`. The static type of
the operand supplies the destructor, so it must resolve through the symbol
table; a cast or a call is reported rather than guessed at.

Rejected here rather than mistranslated: `new T[n]` and `delete[]`, which
would need the element count recorded beside the allocation; `new` of a
non-class or of an abstract class; `delete` of a by-value object; and
`delete` of an operand whose type does not resolve through the symbol table.

A `virtual` destructor occupies a vtable slot under a reserved name, so
`delete base_ptr` dispatches to the most derived destructor, which then
chains to its base through the ordinary epilogue. A derived class always
overrides that slot -- explicitly, or through the destructor it is given
implicitly to chain to the base -- so `virtual` need not be repeated. The
slot is not addressable as a method. Because the base is the first member,
`new Derived()` assigned to a `Base *` is upcast with an
address-preserving cast, which is also why `free` on the base pointer
releases the whole allocation.

Not supported, and reported rather than mistranslated: multiple inheritance,
virtual inheritance, exceptions, most operator overloading (the arithmetic
binaries, the comparisons, `[]`, `=`, `->`, `*` and the compound
assignments are in; a conversion operator, `<<` and the rest are not). Multiple
bases are rejected because the layout admits exactly one: with one base
first, upcasting is free, and that is the property the rest of this
lowering leans on.

The lowering is the same shape Crust uses for `impl` blocks: a method becomes
`Class_method(Class *this, ..)`, a template becomes one struct per
instantiation. That is not a coincidence -- it means a C++ class and a Rust
`impl` over the same data produce the same C, so the two can be mixed in one
unit without a shim.

    -- and the only thing that brings them together is the `#include`.

    Both spellings are spliced, but they are looked for in different

    Anything not found under an `--incdir` is left exactly as written, so
    `<string.h>` still goes to the C front end and `<string>` still
    reaches the supplied containers. The rule never widens on its own:
    with no `--incdir` at all, no angle include is ever spliced.

    A lambda `return` must leave the lambda, not the enclosing function, so
    the body goes inside `do { } while (0)` and `return` becomes `break`.
    That is a structured jump rather than a label, which matters here: the

    enclosing loop frame dropping what is live -- whereas `goto` is refused
    outright whenever anything is live, which is most RAII code.

# reason is self-hosting: py2c transpiles the compiler's own sources, and an
# `import tools.cpprust` inside preproc becomes a real cross-module reference
# to `cpprust__translate`, which is then undefined at link time because this
# module is not in the transpiled set. It cannot easily join that set either
# -- it leans on compiled-pattern objects and match methods (`.sub`, `.start`,
# `.finditer`) that py2c does not lower, whereas `shivyc/crust.py` stays
# inside the supported subset on purpose.
#
# A subprocess removes the symbol entirely, so the self-hosted compiler links
# with no reference to this file, and lowers a `.cpp` include by running it.
# That does mean a `.cpp` include needs python3 and this script on disk at
# compile time; a `.c` or `.rs` build needs neither.
#
# The protocol is deliberately small so the self-hosted caller can use it too,
# where capturing a pipe is awkward: the translated source is written to the
# output file on success, and on failure the *diagnostic* is written to that
# same file and the exit status is non-zero. One file, one status, no pipes.
